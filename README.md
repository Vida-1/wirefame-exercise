How did this go, overall?
This lab went (or rather is going) fairly smoothly. It's taking longer than it should because I was tired when I started it.

What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
No questions related to this submission.

How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
Before starting I thought it would take about 30 minutes to complete this assignment. However, I started working on other assignments so that is not going to be the case as now I have to sleep. Will try to finish up in the morning (or at least after a nap).
